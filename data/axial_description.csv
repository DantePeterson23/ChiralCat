Cc1ccc2c(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)c(C)ccc2c1C(=O)C(C)(C)C,"The given SMILES code corresponds to a complex molecule with a bicyclic structure containing two carbonyl groups. The molecule appears to have multiple stereochemical centers, with the central carbon atoms in the chiral center; however, due to the symmetrical nature of the structure, it is likely that the molecule is achiral overall. The presence of methyl groups attached to the central carbons suggests potential stereoisomerism, but without explicit stereochemistry specified in the SMILES code, it is difficult to determine the exact configuration at each chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is likely to be a racemic mixture of enantiomers."
Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1C(=O)C(C)(C)C,"The provided SMILES code represents a molecule with a central carbonyl group attached to a bulky tert-butyl group on one side and a phenyl ring on the other side.
