The chiral centers in the ligands are denoted by the [C@H] and [C@@H] symbols, indicating chirality at those positions. The complex is coordinated to an iron(II) cation, denoted by [Fe+2]. The complex as a whole is achiral since it has an overall mirror plane due to the presence of identical chiral ligands. The ligands themselves are chiral due to the presence of the specified stereocenters; however, the complex does not exhibit overall chirality due to the symmetry conferred by the two ligands.",4,70
CC[C@@H]1C[C@H](P1C2=CC=C[CH]2)CC.CC[C@@H]1C[C@H](P1C2=CC=C[CH]2)CC.[Fe],"The SMILES code provided describes a complex molecule containing an iron atom coordinated by two chiral ligands. Each ligand belongs to the same structural class, comprising a cyclopentadienyl ring bridged by a central carbon atom to an alkyl chain. The chirality of each ligand is specified by the '@@' and '@' symbols in the SMILES code, indicating the relative stereochemistry at the central carbon atom in each cyclopentadienyl ring. The overall molecule consists of two of these chiral ligands coordinated to an iron atom, implying a chiral center at the iron atom due to the nontrivial connectivity of the ligands. The entire structure forms an organo-iron complex where the ligands confer chirality to the system.",4,88
COc1ccc(P(c2ccc(OC)cc2)c2cc3ccc2CCc2ccc(cc2P(c2ccc(OC)cc2)c2ccc(OC)cc2)CC3)cc1,"The given SMILES code represents a complex molecule with multiple aromatic and aliphatic ring structures connected by phosphorus atoms. The chirality of the molecule, referring to the non-superimposability of its mirror image, is not explicitly defined in the SMILES code provided. Chirality in a molecule is typically denoted using either a lowercase ""l"" or ""d"" prefix in the SMILES representation for each chiral center, indicating the configuration of its substituents. As such, without this specific information included in the SMILES code, it is not possible to determine the chirality of the molecule.",4,1592
